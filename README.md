# ECE_471
### Bradley University Class work for ECE_471 RTOS with STM32 Board

Projects are programmed in c using the STM32CubeIDE and the STM32CubeMX.  
Projects are defined as assignments from the ECE_471 class.

### Class Description
"Advanced programming of small microprocessor-based systems using high-level programming languages applied to real situations: data acquisition, control, communication, small real-time operating systems. Software development for devices from a family of microcontrollers that are relevant to industrial applications. Cross-listed as ECE 571. Prerequisite: ECE 205 or ECE 305 with a minimum grade of C, or proficiency in microcontroller programming in a structural computer language."
